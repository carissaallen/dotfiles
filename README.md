# dotfiles

Contains configuration files I use for the shell, editors, etc. in order for easy future setup and replication. This creates a place for me to incorporate my preferences, cool tips and tricks, etc., so that I can understand my configurations (not just copying + pasting from the internet) and it works uniquely for my own tastes and work habits.

# WIP 

This is a work in progress; I intend to revamp this repository soon, and add more config files (such as my bash profile!) once I get some extra time.
